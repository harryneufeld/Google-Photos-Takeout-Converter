# Google-Photos-Takout-Converter
This tool processes media files exported from **Google Photos Takeout** and restores their metadata, such as the correct creation date, which Google stores separately in JSON files. The tool ensures that both **images and videos** have their original timestamps properly set.

## Features
- Reads **Google Photos Takeout** folders.
- Extracts metadata from corresponding `.json` files.
- Updates **EXIF metadata** for images.
- Sets correct timestamps for **videos**.
- Processes multiple folders automatically and recursively.

## Usage
### Download the Binary (Windows)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/harryneufeld/Google-Photos-Takout-Converter/releases) page.
2. Run the exe
3. When prompted, **enter the takeout-directory** where your (extracted) Google Takeout export is located. Make sure you merged all multiple Takeout folders into one big.
6. The tool will scan all subfolders and process images (`.jpg`, `.png`) and videos (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv`).
7. After processing, your media files will have the correct timestamps. Failed attempts or unsupported mediatypes will leave the metadata-files and the media files untouched.
